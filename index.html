                    <hr class="light">
                    <p>Fake news is the product of websites deliberately pushing false stories, hoaxes and conspiracy theories, and the American public has difficulty differentiating fake news articles from the real ones. 
Fake news has been catapulted into the mainstream throughout the last year, especially during the 2016 presidential election. The perception of these fake websites used to be those that deliberately push false stories, hoaxes and conspiracy theories but now include pretty much any claim of dubious nature. A recent study conducted by professors at NYU, Stanford, and the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) found that about 6/10 U.S. adults read fake news stories, specifically pertaining to politics. The study also suggested that fake news might have been pivotal in the election of President Trump.
The American public now has difficulty trusting real news sites because the sitting president calls any news organization that is critical of him, fake news. There are various articles online just on how to differentiating real news from fake news.</p>
